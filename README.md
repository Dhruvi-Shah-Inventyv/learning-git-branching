# Learn Git

This project is a hands-on exploration of Git, where I dive deep into both basic and advanced Git commands. By following interactive tutorials on [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/), I've been able to understand not only the "how" but also the "why" behind Git operations. This repository serves as both a personal learning diary and a reference guide for effective version control.

## Project Overview

In this project, I covered a range of Git concepts including:

- **Commit:** Recording snapshots of your work.
- **Branching:** Creating and managing multiple lines of development.
- **Merging:** Combining changes from different branches.
- **Rebasing:** Rewriting commit history to maintain a linear sequence.
- **Reverting:** Undoing changes in a controlled manner.
- **Advanced Topics:** Exploring more complex scenarios that arise in real-world projects.

Each level in this project includes detailed instructions and screenshots to help visualize the impact of these commands on your Git history.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different markdown files, each corresponding to a specific level of learning:
